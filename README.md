This is one of my first Javascript projects. The goal was to generate a level that is playable and can be changed by a random seed.

On the left side of the screen the Level Seed and Difficulty can be changed. The game is designed to be always playable on normal difficulty, which could not be the case at Professional or Extreme (because there are way more obstacles).
